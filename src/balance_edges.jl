Generates and returns a minimum spanning tree from the subgraph induced
by `edges` and `nodes`, using Kruskal's MST algorithm. The `edges` are weighted
by `weights`.

## Note:
The `graph` represents the entire graph of the plan, where as `edges` and
`nodes` represent only the sub-graph on which we want to draw the MST.

*Arguments:*
- graph: Underlying Graph object
- edges: Array of edges of the sub-graph
- nodes: Set of nodes of the sub-graph
- weights: Array of weights of `length(edges)` where `weights[i]` is the
           weight of `edges[i]`

*Returns* a BitSet of edges that form a mst.
