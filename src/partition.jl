Partition represents a partition of the nodes of the graph.
It contains plan-specific information that will change each time we
change our plan.

*Arguments:*
- graph:          BaseGraph object that has the underlying network
                  structure of the plan.
- assignment_col: the key denoting the district assignment at the
                  node level
