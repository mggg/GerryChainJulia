        every score at each step of the chain.

        The reversible ReCom chain is slower than the "normal" (i.e. GerryChain-
        flavored) ReCom chain for the same number of _unique_ plans.
        This is for multiple reasons:
            * We draw spanning trees from the uniform distribution using
              a self-avoiding random walk, as described in Wilson 1996.
              This processs is asymptotically slower than drawing a random
              minimum spanning tree (that is, generating random edge weights
              and finding the minimum MST using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm).
            * The chain has a high rejection probability compared to an otherwise
              equivalent ReCom chain. For the reversible chain, we count self-loops
              using the `weight` field in `partition`.

        `n_steps` specifies the number to steps to take _including_ self-loops;
        the number of plans in the returned data will usually be substantially
        smaller than `n_steps`.

        Arguments:
